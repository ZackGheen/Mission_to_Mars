# Mission_to_Mars

This technical derliverable consists of three technical deliverables:
Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components

Tools used to achieve this task were HTML & CSS frameworks in order top give me the desired layout to display in a browser. Additionally I used Bootstrap to "prettyfy" my framework. As well we used Beautiful Soup & Splinter to scrape and extract data from various websites. I used MongoDB a NoSQL database software to hold and recall my data, and finally I used Flask; A Python web framework to build a web based application.
